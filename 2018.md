# 3rd Workshop on Type-Driven Development (TyDe 2018)

## Goals of the workshop

The workshop on Type-Driven Development aims to show how static type
information may be used effectively in the development of computer programs.
The workshop brings together leading researchers and practitioners who are
using or exploring types as a means of program development.

## Call for submissions

We welcome all contributions, both theoretical and practical, on a range of
topics including:

- dependently typed programming;
- generic programming;
- design and implementation of programming languages, exploiting types in novel ways;
- exploiting typed data, data dependent data, or type providers;
- static and dynamic analyses of typed programs;
- tools, IDEs, or testing tools exploiting type information;
- pearls, being elegant, instructive examples of types used in the derivation, calculation, or construction of programs.

### Invited speaker

K. Rustan M. Leino

### Program Committee

- Guillaume Allais, Radboud University Nijmegen, Netherlands
- Zena M. Ariola, University of Oregon, USA
- David Darais, University of Vermont, USA
- Richard Eisenberg, Bryn Mawr College, USA (co-chair)
- Jennifer Hackett, University of Nottingham, UK
- Shin-ya Katsumata, National Institute of Informatics, Japan
- Daan Leijen, Microsoft Research, USA
- Shin-Cheng Mu, Academia Sinica, Taiwan
- Dominic Orchard, University of Kent, UK
- Peter-Michael Osera, Grinnell College, USA
- Zoe Paraskevopoulou, Princeton University, USA
- Alberto Pardo, Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay
- Matthieu Sozeau, University of Paris Diderot, Paris 7, France
- Niki Vazou, University of Maryland, USA (co-chair)

### Proceedings and Copyright

We will have formal proceedings, published by the ACM. Accepted papers will be
included in the ACM Digital Library. Authors must grant ACM publication rights
upon acceptance, but may retain copyright if they wish. Authors are encouraged
to publish auxiliary material with their paper (source code, test data, and so
forth). The proceedings will be freely available for download from the ACM
Digital Library from one week before the start of the conference until two
weeks after the conference.

The official publication date is the date the papers are made available in the
ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of
the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any
patent filings related to published work.

### Submission details

Submissions should fall into one of two categories:

- Regular research papers (12 pages)
- Extended abstracts (2 pages)

The bibliography will not be counted against the page limits for either
category.

Regular research papers are expected to present novel and interesting research
results, and will be included in the formal proceedings. Extended abstracts
should report work in progress that the authors would like to present at the
workshop. Extended abstracts will be distributed to workshop attendees but will
not be published in the formal proceedings.

We welcome submissions from PC members (with the exception of the two
co-chairs), but these submissions will be held to a higher standard.

Submission is handled through HotCRP:

https://tyde18.hotcrp.com/

All submissions should be in portable document format (PDF) and formatted using
the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines:

http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/

Note that the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines have changed from previous years! In
particular, submissions should use the new ‘acmart’ format and the two-column
‘sigplan’ subformat (not to be confused with the one-column ‘acmlarge’
subformat!).

Extended abstracts must be submitted with the label ‘Extended abstract’ clearly
in the title.

### Important Dates

- Regular paper deadline: Wednesday, June 6, 2018 Wednesday, June 13, 2018
- Extended abstract deadline: Wednesday, June 13, 2018
- Author notification: Friday, June 29, 2018
- Deadline for camera ready version: August 5, 2018
- Workshop: Thursday, September 27, 2018

### Travel Support

Student attendees with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant to
help cover travel expenses. PAC also offers other support, such as for
child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for companions of
SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for travel from
locations outside of North America and Europe. For details on the PAC program,
see its web page:

# Workshop on Type-Driven Development (TyDe)

The workshop on Type-Driven Development aims to show how static type
information may be used effectively in the development of computer
programs. Co-located with [ICFP](http://icfpconference.org/), this
workshop brings together leading researchers and practitioners who
are using or exploring types as a means of program development.

## Previous workshops

[2017, Oxford](2017)

[2016, Nara](2016)

## Steering committee

The TyDe Workshop Steering Committee comprises three pairs of TyDe Workshop co-chairs and three appointed members-at-large.

Each year, shortly after the date of the TyDe Workshop, the Steering Committee appoints two co-chairs for the next TyDe Workshop. The steering committee additionally appoints a new member-at-large to succeed the currently longest serving member-at-large. The newly appointed co-chairs and the member-at-large then join the Steering Committee, while the longest serving former co-chairs and member-at-large step down.

The chair of the Steering Committee is one of the two longest serving co-chairs.

Should there be vacancies within the Steering Committee, e.g. due to a member stepping down early, the Steering Committee appoints members to fill the vacancies and, if necessary, decides on the succession ordering.

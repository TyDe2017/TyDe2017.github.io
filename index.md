## Workshop on Type-Driven Development (TyDe)

The workshop on Type-Driven Development aims to show how static type
information may be used effectively in the development of computer
programs. Co-located with [ICFP](http://icfpconference.org/), this
workshop brings together leading researchers and practitioners who
are using or exploring types as a means of program development.

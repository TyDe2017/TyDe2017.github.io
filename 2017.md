## 2nd Workshop on Type-Driven Development (TyDe '17)

### Dependently Typed and Generic Programming

### Goals of the workshop

The workshop on Type-Driven Development aims to show how static type
information may be used effectively in the development of computer
programs. The workshop, co-located with
[ICFP](http://icfp17.sigplan.org/), unifies two workshops: the
Workshop on Dependently Typed Programming and the Workshop on Generic
Programming.

These two research areas have a rich history and bridge both theory and
practice. Novel techniques explored by both communities has gradually
spread to more mainstream languages. This workshop aims to bring
together leading researchers and practitioners in generic programming
and dependently typed programming from around the world, and features
papers capturing the state of the art in these important areas.

We welcome all contributions, both theoretical and practical, on:

  * dependently typed programming;
  * generic programming;
  * design and implementation of programming languages, exploiting
    types in novel ways;
  * exploiting typed data, data dependent data, or type providers;
  * static and dynamic analyses of typed programs;
  * tools, IDEs, or testing tools exploiting type information;
  * pearls, being elegant, instructive examples of types used in the
    derivation, calculation, or construction of programs.

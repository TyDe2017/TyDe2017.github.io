## 2nd Workshop on Type-Driven Development (TyDe 2017)

### Goals of the workshop

The workshop on Type-Driven Development aims to show how static type
information may be used effectively in the development of computer
programs. Co-located with [ICFP](http://icfp17.sigplan.org/), this
workshop brings together leading researchers and practitioners who
are using or exploring types as a means of program development.

We welcome all contributions, both theoretical and practical, on a
range of topics including:

  * dependently typed programming;
  * generic programming;
  * design and implementation of programming languages, exploiting
    types in novel ways;
  * exploiting typed data, data dependent data, or type providers;
  * static and dynamic analyses of typed programs;
  * tools, IDEs, or testing tools exploiting type information;
  * pearls, being elegant, instructive examples of types used in the
    derivation, calculation, or construction of programs.

### Invited speaker - Andrew Kennedy

#### Driving types into PHP

Facebook’s main website, ads platform, and much of its internal tooling is implemented in PHP, a language not known for elegance or best practice in programming language design. Five years ago Facebook embarked on an ambitious project to migrate its code base to Hack, which takes the syntax of PHP, removes the worst features, and adds static typing and modern constructs for asynchronous programming.  Its type system is an interesting mixture of ideas from Java, C#, Scala, and Caml, with flow-sensitive typing thrown in to capture typical PHP idioms. Type-driven development is now more than accepted: developers demand ever richer types, and evolution of the codebase goes hand-in-hand with evolution of the type system and programming language. Development-driven typing, anyone?

### Proceedings and Copyright

We plan to have formal proceedings, published by the ACM. Accepted
papers will be included in the ACM Digital Library. Authors must grant
ACM publication rights upon acceptance, but may retain copyright if they
wish. Authors are encouraged to publish auxiliary material with their
paper (source code, test data, and so forth). The proceedings will be
freely available for download from the ACM Digital Library from one week
before the start of the conference until two weeks after the conference.

### Submission details

Submissions should fall into one of two categories:

  * Regular research papers (12 pages)
  * Extended abstracts (2 pages)

The bibliography will not be counted against the page limits for
either category.

Regular research papers are expected to present novel and interesting
research results, and will be included in the formal
proceedings. Extended abstracts should report work in progress that
the authors would like to present at the workshop. Extended abstracts
will be distributed to workshop attendees but will not be published in
the formal proceedings.

We welcome submissions from PC members (with the exception of the two
co-chairs), but these submissions will be held to a higher standard.

Submission is handled through [HotCRP](https://icfp-tyde17.hotcrp.com/).

All submissions should be in portable document format (PDF) and
formatted using the [ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/).

*Note* that the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines have changed from
previous years!  In particular, submissions should use the new
'acmart' format and the two-column 'sigplan' subformat (not to be
confused with the one-column 'acmlarge' subformat!).

Extended abstracts must be submitted with the label 'Extended
abstract' clearly in the title.

### Important Dates

  * Regular paper deadline: ~~Wednesday, 24th May, 2017~~ Sunday, 28th May, 2017 (extended deadline)
  * Extended abstract deadline: Wednesday, 7th June, 2017
  * Author notification: Wednesday, 28th June, 2017
  * Deadline for camera ready version: Saturday, 15th July, 2017
  * Workshop: Sunday, 3rd September, 2017

### Travel Support

Student attendees with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant
to help cover travel expenses. PAC also offers other support, such as
for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for
companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for
travel from locations outside of North America and Europe. For details
on the PAC program, see its [web page](http://www.sigplan.org/PAC/).

# 4th Workshop on Type-Driven Development (TyDe 2019)

## Goals of the workshop

The workshop on Type-Driven Development aims to show how static type information may be used effectively in the development of computer programs. Co-located with [ICFP](http://icfp19.sigplan.org/), this workshop brings together leading researchers and practitioners who are using or exploring types as a means of program development.

## Call for submissions

We welcome all contributions, both theoretical and practical, on a
range of topics including:

-   dependently typed programming;
-   generic programming;
-   design and implementation of programming languages, exploiting types in novel ways;
-   exploiting typed data, data dependent data, or type providers;
-   static and dynamic analyses of typed programs;
-   tools, IDEs, or testing tools exploiting type information;
-   pearls, being elegant, instructive examples of types used in the derivation, calculation, or construction of programs.

### Submission details

Submissions should fall into one of two categories:

-   Regular research papers (12 pages)
-   Extended abstracts (2 pages)

The bibliography will not be counted against the page limits for
either category.

Regular research papers are expected to present novel and interesting
research results, and will be included in the formal
proceedings. Extended abstracts should report work in progress that
the authors would like to present at the workshop; they will be evaluated primarily for relevance and interest. Extended abstracts
will be distributed to workshop attendees but will not be published in
the formal proceedings.

We welcome submissions from PC members (with the exception of the two
co-chairs), but these submissions will be held to a higher standard.

Submission for regular papers is handled through [the HotCRP site](https://tyde19.hotcrp.com);
**extended abstracts should be sent by email to the chairs**.
All submissions should be in portable document format (PDF) and
formatted using the [ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/).
*Note* that the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines have changed from
previous years! In particular, submissions should use the new
‘acmart’ format and the two-column ‘sigplan’ subformat (not to be
confused with the one-column ‘acmlarge’ subformat!).

Extended abstracts must be submitted with the label 'Extended
abstract' clearly in the title.

### Proceedings and Copyright

We will have formal proceedings, published by the ACM. Accepted full
papers will be included in the ACM Digital Library. Authors must grant
ACM publication rights upon acceptance, but may retain copyright if they
wish. Authors are encouraged to publish auxiliary material with their
paper (source code, test data, and so forth). The proceedings will be
freely available for download from the ACM Digital Library from one week
before the start of the conference until two weeks after the conference.

The official publication date is the date the papers are made
available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks
prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication
date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published
work.

### Travel Support

Student attendees with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant
to help cover travel expenses. PAC also offers other support, such as
for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for
companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for
travel from locations outside of North America and Europe. For details
on the PAC program, see its [web page](http://www.sigplan.org/PAC/).


## Schedule

### Invited speaker

We are delighted to have [Conor McBride](https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/) from the University of Strathclyde, giving an invited talk on **Cubes, Cats, and Effects**:

> Categorical structure is a source of great guidance in Type-Directed Development, despite the fact that today’s advanced type systems do a relatively poor job of expressing it. Meanwhile, recent progress in typed languages for algebraic effects and handlers do a less than perfect job of capturing the coherences which handlers for effectful operations should respect. The problem, as ever, is equality, but Cubical Type Theory offers an opportunity to improve the situation, by changing the way in which coherence properties are captured and ensuring uniformity in the treatment of things and of the equations which relate things. Correspondingly, I will offer grounds for optimism.
